## background
Iannis Xenakis came up with stochastic synthesis in [TODO]. A vague
term to describe the direct creation of waveforms from random
processes. 

## Gendy1
Xenakis' orignal program Gendy1 (originally written in QBASIC by Marie-Helene Serra) performed
non-realtime dynamic stochastic synthesis.

## extending dynamic stochastic synthesis

### other implementations

Nick Collins has implemented several versions of the GendyX prgrams as
[SuperCollider UGens](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Gendy1.html).

## future work
